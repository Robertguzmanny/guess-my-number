# Guess My Number

## Introduction
"Guess My Number" is a fun and interactive game built with React that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Each guess will give you a hint whether your number is too high or too low until you find the correct number.

This project is designed to showcase the fundamentals of React state management and component-based architecture. It's also a demonstration of how to handle user input and feedback in a single-page application (SPA).
